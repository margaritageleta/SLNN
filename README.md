# Pattern recognition with Single Layer Neural Network (SLNN)
### Unconstrained Optimization project.

The aim of the project is to build a Single Layer Neural Network (abbreviated as SLNN) from zero in Python that would be capable of recognizing a set of target numbers. The numbers from the [0,9] interval will be used as targets. Each number has a 7x5 pixel matrix representation, with values 0 and 1.
